# Introduction

Welcome to the the Edumaps API! You can use our API to access Edumaps API endpoints, which can get information on various resources in our database.

We have language bindings in Shell only! The Edumaps API is purely a RESTful api service.

You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.
