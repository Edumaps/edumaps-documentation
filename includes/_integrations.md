# Integrations

Integrations or third-party applications as they can be known come in different flavours. There are three types of integrations that can be used with Edumaps. These are:

* Independent oAuth (Authorisation Grant) Applications
* Embedded Web Applications
* Microservice APIs & Service Calls

They come in different contexts too, whether they are owned by the organisation or a user, whether it is public, private or [protected]() or whether as an embedded web application should the context fall under the category of a production application, management/systen administration application or backend service that listens out for events.
