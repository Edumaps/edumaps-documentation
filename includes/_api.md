Edumaps uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Edumaps API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).

Edumaps expects for the API key to be included in all API requests to the server in a header that looks like the following:

`Authorization: q2sdaadsfsdf90qsqsqkjfds!dfewqkjr2344e5`

You must replace <code>q2sdaadsfsdf90qsqsqkjfds!dfewqkjr2344e5</code> with your personal API key.
